# Game GUI Experiments (for MonoGame framework)

This is a test project where I have been trying experiment and create UI elements from scratch you typically find in games such as text, buttons, a scrollable list and its associated features such as masking.

It is a verbose project due to just wanting the detail of implementation and not the design of an API (this is why it's verbose to setup a scroll system, the detail is just exposed instead of an easy to use API).

A compiled version is in the release section here (https://github.com/rbartsch/game-gui-experiments/releases)

To build you may need to install MonoGame 3.6 (http://www.monogame.net/downloads/) and Visual Studio 2017 or later. C# 7.0 is used (.NET Framework 4.7)
