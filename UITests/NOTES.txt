To make a scroll system that works with just text:
Add a scrollcontainer, add a scrollelement to it. Then add a textarea (guidrawable) to scroll element.
When the textarea's text gets larger vertically, expand the textarea's rectangle area vertically to match.
Then at the same time update the scrollelement's rectangle area vertically as well.
