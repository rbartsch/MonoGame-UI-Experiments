TODO:
- Text/paragraph align left, centre, right for textarea
- Global/GUI manager for drawing and destroying/creating GUI elements
- Text input field
- Selectable box/dropdown list (with just text). i.e a combo box.
- Toggle buttons
- Radio buttons
- Checkbox buttons
- Sliders
- Tooltips
- Notifications
- Popups/events (think Paradox GSGs, can contain one or more buttons - useful for decisions)
- Right click context menu
- Graphs like bar chart, pie chart, etc.
- Tabs
- General panels that can house complete GUI elements like a scroll bar and can use tabs to switch between panels
- GUI definition files for designing layout that is read and constructed. i.e define button with texture at point X,Y with a text element that contains the text
